# Write Commands
New write commands for new wire protocol. The new "write commands" are all implemented as server Commands run using "db.$cmd.findOne(...)".  The legacy write operations did not recieve responses, but commands do recieve responses, so sending writes as "commands" ensures that all writes get a response.  Note that this means the "write commands" are layered on top of the legacy wire protocol, rather than replacing it.


-------------

## Write Commands Declarations
Classes registering the write commands into the command system. When a write command is recieved by a mongod, this is the entry point.

## Batch Executor
Class that actually does the work of executing a batch of writes on a mongod.

## Write Commands Utilities
Common utilities that are shared by the write commands, such as authorization checks.

## Config Coordinator
Core config server write management.  Sends a batch of the new write commands to the config servers.

## Write Commands mongos Execution
New wire protocol writes (in mongos) TODO: Separate this into smaller groups and reorganize this section.  There are different parts to it.  The cluster\_write\_cmd file has the actual "Command" classes, the batch\_write\_exec files have the actually "runner" of the batch, while the batch\_write\_op and write\_op files are classes that are used to track the lifecycle of batch write and single write operations respectively

#### Files
- src/mongo/s/commands/cluster\_write\_cmd.cpp   (mongos)
- src/mongo/s/write\_ops/batch\_write\_exec.cpp   (mongod, tools, mongos)
- src/mongo/s/write\_ops/batch\_write\_exec.h   (mongod, tools, mongos)

## Write Commands Upconvert
Code to convert incoming writes on a mongos from a legacy client into a write command for talking to new mongods and convert write command responses into legacy getLastError responses.

#### Files
- src/mongo/s/write\_ops/batch\_upconvert.cpp   (mongod, tools, mongos)
- src/mongo/s/write\_ops/batch\_upconvert.h   (mongod, tools, mongos)

#### [Interface](interface/5)

#### [Dependencies](dependencies/5)

-------------

## Write Commands Downconvert
Code to convert the new style write commands into legacy operations using getLastError, hidden behind the same interface.  This should all be removed in the next major release.

#### Files
- src/mongo/s/write\_ops/batch\_downconvert.cpp   (mongod, tools, mongos)
- src/mongo/s/write\_ops/batch\_downconvert.h   (mongod, tools, mongos)

## Wire Version
Header to enumerate the wire protocol version, along with the max and min supported versions.  The versions so far carry semantic information such as whether aggregation can return cursors or whether write commands are supported.

#### Files
- src/mongo/db/wire\_version.h   (mongod, tools, mongos)
