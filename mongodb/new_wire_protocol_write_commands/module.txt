####### new_wire_protocol_write_commands #######


# New write commands for new wire protocol. The new "write commands" are all actual Commands run
# using "db.$cmd.findOne(...)". The reason for this is that the old wire protocol didn't have
# acknowledgements for anything BUT queries (which include commands), so everything is now a query
# so we can get acknowledgements for writes (and not just for queries).
