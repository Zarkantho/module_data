        are all actual Commands run# using "db.$cmd.findOne(...)". The reason for
        this is that the old wire protocol didn''t have# acknowledgements for anything
        BUT queries (which include commands), so everything is now a query# so we
        can get acknowledgements for writes (and not just for queries).'
