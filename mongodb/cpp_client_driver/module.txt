# Stubs so that the client driver can build alone since our deps are screwed up. We have symbols
# that are required by shared code that are very internal to the server, so if we didn't have these
# files we'd either need to include the whole server (which we want to avoid) or the build wouldn't
# successfully link.

# The Core C++ Client Driver Library
## who uses these, and why? maybe this description should be broken up into
## some components, e.g. what exactly is a 'dbclient', a 'dbclientcursor'
