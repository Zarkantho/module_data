-   comments: '# mongod''s version of a "Client". This is the big bucket of global
        state.# There is also the concept of a "Context" that one can take at the
        beginning of an operation that# holds a subset of the global state. There
        is also a "ReadContext" and a "WriteContext which# take locks. These are all
        nested classes in "Client". It''s a bizarre situation because# "client.h"
        contains the declaration of the class, but there are two different definitions.
        One in# "s_only.cpp" for mongos, and one in "client.cpp" for mongod. This
        means that mongos files may# contain "client.h" and pass compile fine when
        using something in it, but then may fail link# because it happens to be something
        that''s only defined in "client.cpp". I don''t see any# definitions so far
        for "Context" in mongos, and a grep for "Client::WriteContext::WriteContext"#
        (the definition of the WriteContext constructor) only shows up in client.cpp,
        which is mongod# only.'
