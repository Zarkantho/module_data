## general notes:
## 1 - maybe we should describe third-party dependencies everywhere in here
## e.g. boost::whatever, v8, etc. but i'm really not sure
## 2 - i'd like to have an idea of what-locks-are-held-where, i'm secretly
## hoping that such a map could be 'neatly' overlaid on top of the
## 'module map'.
## 3 - similar to 2, i would like to know 'what runs in what thread'.
## 4 - for each set of files, why not tally lines of code? e.g.:
## grep ; <blah> | wc -l

# "s_only.cpp" for mongos, and one in "client.cpp" for mongod. This means that mongos files may
# contain "client.h" and pass compile fine when using something in it, but then may fail link

# Bizarre legacy sharding code.
#
# From writeback_listener.h
# "The writeback listener takes back write attempts that were made against a wrong shard.
# (Wrong here in the sense that the target chunk moved before this mongos had a chance to
# learn so.) It is responsible for reapplying these writes to the correct shard."
#
# So basically, the mongos sends an operation to the mongod, and the writeback listener (running on
# the mongos) says to the mongod every now and again, "yo, have I screwed up recently?". The mongod
# is then like "yeah bro, you screwed up, you wrote all these things to the wrong place and the
# writeback listener is like "thanks man" and tries to write them to the correct shard. Meanwhile
# the user is like "I'm so glad my data was written". This should go away because of the new write
# commands.
