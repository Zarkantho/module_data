# Replica Set Sync and Initial Sync
Code to do sync and inital sync.  Note that this is a complex class heirarchy, and the files do not map one to one with class definitions and implementation.  The sync thread is started and run in "rs\_sync.cpp".  It handles doing the initial sync if applicable, then tailing the oplog.

## Files
- src/mongo/db/repl/rs\_initialsync.cpp   (mongod, tools)
- src/mongo/db/repl/rs\_sync.cpp   (mongod, tools)
- src/mongo/db/repl/rs\_sync.h   (mongod, tools, mongos)
- src/mongo/db/repl/sync.cpp   (mongod, tools)
- src/mongo/db/repl/sync.h   (mongod, tools, mongos)

# Replica Set Background Sync Threads
Threads that actually handle syncing the oplog from the sync source. This includes the thread that actually reads the data from the source as well as the thread that notifies the source of how far it read

## Files
- src/mongo/db/repl/bgsync.cpp   (mongod, tools)
- src/mongo/db/repl/bgsync.h   (mongod, tools)

#### [Interface](interface/3)

#### [Dependencies](dependencies/3)

-------------

# Sync Source Feedback
Code to tell the sync source how far we have progressed in the oplog.  For new versions this is the "replSetUpdatePosition command, but for old versions this was a "ghost cursor" which would only be advanced when the batch had been processed

## Files
- src/mongo/db/repl/sync\_source\_feedback.cpp   (mongod, tools)
- src/mongo/db/repl/sync\_source\_feedback.h   (mongod, tools, mongos)

#### [Interface](interface/4)

#### [Dependencies](dependencies/4)

#### [Interface](interface/6)

#### [Dependencies](dependencies/6)

# Elections
Commands that are sent and recieved during election as well as implementation of some class methods related to elections.  Note that there is not a clear class separation between things related to elections and things not related to elections, so the method implementations in this file span multiple classes.

# Master Check Helpers

# State Transition Manager
Thin layer on top of the main replica set class.  Seems to be intended to manage state transitions in a replica set.  It does things like look at the current state of our set to determine if the node should step down or try to elect ourself as primary.  This gets called by the heartbeat thread when a state change is detected.

## Files
- src/mongo/db/repl/manager.cpp   (mongod, tools)

#### [Interface](interface/16)
