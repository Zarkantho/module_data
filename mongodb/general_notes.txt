## general notes:
## 1 - maybe we should describe third-party dependencies everywhere in here
## e.g. boost::whatever, v8, etc. but i'm really not sure
## 2 - i'd like to have an idea of what-locks-are-held-where, i'm secretly
## hoping that such a map could be 'neatly' overlaid on top of the
## 'module map'.
## 3 - similar to 2, i would like to know 'what runs in what thread'.
## 4 - for each set of files, why not tally lines of code? e.g.:
## grep ; <blah> | wc -l
