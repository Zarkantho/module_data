- Make script to autumatically diff the current files in the project with willitlink data

- Make modules nested and grouped by high level category
Example:
    Query system:
        Aggregation
        Core Queries
        Geo
        FTS
    Storage:
        Journal
        Data Files
        mmap library

- Clean up top level overview of the module and provide a way to "drill down"
  Instead of the "Interface" section containing every symbol, provide a "Used By" section that shows
  what other modules this system is used by.  Then the drill down can show the symbols that are used
  by that other module specifically

- Convert the current ".txt" file into something more consistent (maybe markdown) and parse that, or
  else remove support for that entirely

- Consolidate scripts into a single script that takes various documentation file types and generates
  the whole project tree

- Remove the local willitlink data when integration is better with the file diff

- Attempt to put the file diff into an SCons plugin, at the same time as the assert code generator
